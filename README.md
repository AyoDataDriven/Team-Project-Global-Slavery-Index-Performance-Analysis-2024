## Technical Report

## Introduction

Modern slavery is hidden in plain sight and deeply intertwined with daily life across the world. Every day, people are tricked, coerced, or forced into exploitative situations they cannot refuse or escape. Many products and services consumed globally carry hidden human costs.

An estimated **50 million people** were living in modern slavery in 2021 — an increase of **10 million since 2016**.

## What is the Global Slavery Index?

The **Global Slavery Index (GSI)** is Walk Free’s flagship report providing national estimates of modern slavery across **160 countries**. It draws on:

- Nationally representative household surveys (75+ countries)
- Survivor interviews
- National vulnerability assessments
- Government response evaluations

Except for external contributions, the index is produced by **Walk Free**.

## Project Objective

This project analyzes global patterns of modern slavery and human trafficking using secondary data from the **Global Slavery Index 2023**.

### Key Goals

- Identify regions and countries most affected  
- Examine major vulnerability contributors (governance, inequality, conflict)  
- Evaluate government response effectiveness  
- Explore correlations between risk factors and slavery prevalence  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for prevention and intervention  

The aim is to convert complex global data into actionable insights that support **human rights advocacy, policy design, and anti-trafficking strategies**.

## Key Insights

### Global Patterns
- India has the highest absolute number of enslaved persons (11M+)  
- North Korea has the highest per-capita prevalence (104.6 per 1,000)  
- Asia dominates top slavery estimates  
- Western democracies lead in governance response  

### Vulnerability Drivers

| Factor | Correlation |
|------|------------|
| Governance Issues | 0.94 |
| Basic Needs Gap | 0.80 |
| Disenfranchised Groups | 0.78 |
| Inequality | 0.74 |
| Conflict Impact | 0.57 |

Governance failures are the **strongest driver** of modern slavery.
